##U sing land-use change projections of integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems expansion in Brazil within the context of the Paris Agreement

One of the targets in Brazil’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the
Paris Agreement is the expansion of 5 million hectares of integrated crop-livestock-
forestry systems (ICLFS) until 2030. Although there is some notion of the extent
where this expansion could occur, there is no systematic accounting on the role of
soil carbon to bring this agricultural system to carbon neutrality, or even to be a
sink of carbon. In that context, the objective of this research plan is to produce
spatially-explicit projections of the expansion of ICLFS predicted in Brazil’s NDC
and estimate the carbon balance, the provision of other ecosystem services and
financial revenue. This will be done with the use of ad-hoc scenarios applied to land-
use modeling framework, comprised of a land-use change and a crop-productivity
and carbon-storage model. The final results of this study will provide information
for decision makers, for the implementation of ICLFS across Brazil.
